# Iggy-Player
A lightweight media player in rust using gstreamer.
Nowhere near to completion - collaboration is welcome!

At the moment the video file needs to be set as a URI in the filepath variable in src/main.rs for testing.

TODO;
 
- Function that allows seeking to N places in the video - to be used for a scrollbar in guis
- build in url/file path handling - as urls to videos can be played. 
- Handling of subtitle / multiple audio tracks
- Playlists 
- Shuffling, loop
